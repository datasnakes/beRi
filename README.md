# beRi  [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/CRANbeRi/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/CRANbeRi/Lobby)

beRi "beri environments for R installations" is an R environment, R installation, and R package management system for R. 

The project was initially conceptualized by [Robert Gilmore](https://github.com/grabear). Gilmore proposed the project to [hackseq18](https://www.hackseq.com/) where it was developed over 3 days by a great team of [developers](#hackseq18-team-members). It ultimately went on to win hackseq18.

## What is beRi?

beRi is a suite of Python packages composed of the following components: (1) [renv](https://github.com/datasnakes/renv), a virtual environment manager for R; [rinse](https://github.com/datasnakes/rinse), an R installation and R version manager; and (3) [rut](https://github.com/datasnakes/rut), an R utility tool for installing packages, managing native R configuration files, and setting up local CRAN-like repositories. These packages will be developed in separate repositories as standalone command-line interfaces (CLIs). [beRi](https://github.com/datasnakes/beRi) will also be developed in a separate repository but will depend on the other three packages.
